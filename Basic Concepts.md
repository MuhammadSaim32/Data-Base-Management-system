# Basic Concepts

- ( Data,information ,database ,dbms and file system approach  from it series)
## **Three-Schema Architecture in DBMS**

### **Definition**

The **three-schema architecture** divides a database system into three levels to achieve **data abstraction** and **data independence** — separating how data is stored, structured, and viewed.
### **1. Internal Schema (Physical Level)**

- Describes **how data is physically stored** in memory or disk.
- Includes file structures, indexes, and access paths.
- Managed by the **DBMS storage engine**.
- **Example (Full-Stack App):**  
    MySQL stores your `products` and `orders` table data as files and indexes on disk.
### **2. Conceptual Schema (Logical Level)**

- Describes **what data is stored** and **relationships** among data.
- Defines the **entire database structure** — tables, columns, keys, relationships.
- Hidden from physical storage details.
- **Example (Full-Stack App):**  
    Tables like `users`, `products`, `orders` and foreign key relations you define in SQL or Prisma schema.

###  **3. External Schema (View Level)**

- Defines **how users or applications see the data**.
- Allows multiple customized **views** for different users.
- Provides **security and abstraction** (users see only what they need).
- **Example (Full-Stack App):**
    - **Frontend (React):** Customer dashboard shows only their orders.
    - **Admin panel:** Displays all orders, stock, and user details.
    - Both views come from the same underlying database.
###  **Purpose / Advantages**

|Goal|Description|
|---|---|
|**Data Abstraction**|Hides lower-level details from users.|
|**Data Independence**|You can change storage or schema without breaking the app.|
|**Multiple Views**|Different users see data tailored to their role.|
|**Simplified Management**|DBAs, developers, and users can work independently.|

### **In a Full-Stack Context**

| Level          | Example                                               |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **External**   | React frontend + API endpoints (specific user views). |
| **Conceptual** | Database schema in MySQL / PostgreSQL.                |
| **Internal**   | Physical data storage managed by DBMS engine.         |
